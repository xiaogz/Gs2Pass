# Gs2Pass
This AutoHotKey script (v1.1.21.00) automates the tedious 260-character-long password input for Golden Sun 2: The Lost Age GameBoyAdvance game.

This script works with AutohotKey(http://ahkscript.org/download/) and VisualBoyAdvance GBA emulator. The ROM for Golden Sun 2 can only be kept for 24hrs legally though... 

A pre-compiled DLL file (built using Visual Studio 2010) is available here.

To use: after installing AHK, VisualBoyAdvance emulator, and obtaining the ROM rile, clone this repo and open the 'pass.ahk' file. Then, open VBA and load the Golden Sun 2 rom and navigate to the password input screen (like the picture shown).

Copy the contents of the 'GS2SamplePass.txt' into the textbox and click 'Go'.

You can find various other passwords online (you can also use bronze/silver passwords, but they lack end-game content such as all the Djinns)
